# Circular Day Dial Component

## Overview
A **24-hour circular dial** visualization that displays scheduled events as colored arc segments around a clock-like interface. Built with **SwiftUI native components** (no external libraries needed).

## Implementation

### ✅ **SwiftUI Native Solution**
No built-in SwiftUI component exists for this, so we created a custom implementation using:
- `Circle()` with `.trim()` for event arcs
- `ZStack` for layering
- `ForEach` with rotation for hour markers
- Pure SwiftUI geometry calculations

### Architecture

```
CircularDayDial (Main View)
├── hourMarkers (Background layer)
│   ├── Circle outline
│   ├── 60 tick marks (5-minute intervals)
│   └── Hour numbers (12, 3, 6, 9)
├── EventArc (Colored segments)
│   └── One per scheduled event
└── centerContent
    ├── Day name (SUNDAY)
    ├── Total scheduled time
    └── Current/next event info
```

## Key Features

### 1. **24-Hour Visualization**
- Circular clock face with 12, 3, 6, 9 hour markers
- 60 tick marks (every 6°) for minutes
- 12 o'clock at top

### 2. **Event Arcs**
- Colored arc segments show scheduled blocks
- Width: 30pt
- Colors: Customizable per event
- Smooth rounded caps

### 3. **Center Info Display**
- Day name (SUNDAY, MONDAY, etc.)
- Total scheduled hours (2h00m scheduled)
- First/current event details
- Event title and duration

### 4. **Clean Design**
- Dark background
- Semi-transparent white circles and ticks
- Vibrant event colors (orange, green, etc.)
- Minimalist, readable typography

## Usage

```swift
CircularDayDial(
    events: [
        DayEvent(title: "Focus", startHour: 10, duration: 2.083, color: .green),
        DayEvent(title: "Meeting", startHour: 14, duration: 1.5, color: .orange)
    ],
    selectedDate: Date()
)
```

## Data Model

### DayEvent
```swift
struct DayEvent: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let title: String
    let startHour: Double  // 0-24 (9.5 = 9:30 AM)
    let duration: Double   // in hours (2.5 = 2.5 hours)
    let color: Color
}
```

## How It Works

### Hour Calculation
```swift
// Convert hour (0-24) to angle
let angle = (startHour / 24) * 360 - 90  // -90 for 12 o'clock at top
```

### Arc Drawing
```swift
Circle()
    .trim(from: startHour / 24, to: (startHour + duration) / 24)
    .stroke(color, style: StrokeStyle(lineWidth: arcWidth, lineCap: .round))
    .rotationEffect(.degrees(-90))  // Start at 12 o'clock
```

## ✅ No External Dependencies
- **100% SwiftUI native**
- No third-party libraries
- Clean, maintainable code
